<hr /><br />

WhatsApp Notification Sound Changer allows you to set a custom notification sound for the [WhatsApp Web client](https://web.whatsapp.com). Install and launch the extension, upload an audio track, then refresh the page for the new sound to be used for notifications.

Uploaded audio data is stored exclusively on-device. Additonally, the extension does not collect data or report back to any server or cloud service.

This project was born out of necessity. The default WhatsApp web sound is too similar to similar to several other application's notification sounds, with no way to change it or replace it with a custom one. After browsing multiple forums and not finding a solution, I decided to solve the problem.
